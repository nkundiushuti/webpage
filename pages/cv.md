Having more than 6 years experience as a software engineer, in 2010 I gave a new start to my career by moving to Barcelona to start a Master's in signal processing and machine learning applied to music. Then I worked as a Research engineer for the research institute [INESC][4] in Porto, where I was involved in a project aiming at modelling groove, and I developed a few real-time tools for audio analysis and transformation. In 2013 I have started my PhD at [Music Technology Group][2], Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona as a part of an European FP7 project which was aiming at transforming the way classical music is enjoyed. My [PhD thesis][3] concerns separating the audio corresponding to the instruments in an orchestral music mixture. I gave a new flavour to the topic by proposing a deep learning approach. I [code][5] in Python and C++, mainly using open source library and I try to publish everything I do as open source. I aim at making my work transparent and reproducible, so I can foster future development and creativity.
