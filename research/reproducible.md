Code is made available through github, either at my [repository][1] or at the research groups I have been with, [MTG][2] and [SMC-INESC][3]. 

Except parts of code which I couldn't publish because of non-disclosure agreements (almost half of my PhD), the research presented in [papers][4] is documented in the repositories referenced in the papers, along with links to the datasets and instructions on how to replicate those experiments.
