I am glad to have attended this meetup. There were three talks and I learned something from each one. 

First, there is this interactive plotting tool called [plotly][4]. You can zoom-in, check values, use the notebook, export JSON which you can access in web apps. More details [here][1]. 

Then, podcast automatization: slicing, encoding, normalization. You would think there is software out there for that and it is trivial to automatize. Guess what? [it is not][2]. Ah...I was impressed by [Travis][5], test your github code in minutes.

Finally, I am not really interested in [bots][3] but the process of responding to concurrent requests and making sure all the tasks work smoothly requires some attention. This is where [Celery][6] comes into action.
